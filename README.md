# Nft site - responsive
## Details
Same website as the Ninth Project, but with changes in the HTML and CSS structure, trying to be responsive.
In this project, I learned:
  - % units, to handle the width of elements.
  - rem (root relative font size) units, to handle the size of fonts. This will adapt to the user browser font size (default: 1rem = 16px).
  - em (element relative font size) units, to handle padding, margin, and the spacing of elements. This spacing will adapt to the font size of the element.
  - @media() to change or add properties when the viewport changes.
I will delete this repository and add the changes to the original project after I finish the current Module.
